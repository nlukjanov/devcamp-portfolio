<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I have started to learn web development and specifically Rails in late 2016. The decision came out of intereste to programming and to web development particularly. I went through several introductory course to decide that Ruby on Rails would be most suitable for my goals. Since then I have been studying in my free time and developing my skills through variety of courses and web apps.</p>
